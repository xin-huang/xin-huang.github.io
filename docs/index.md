# About

Hello, I am a student has been working on many problems:

- Detecting natural selection
- Estimating selective pressures
- Quantifying time-varying selective pressures
- Inferring the distribution of fitness effects
- Detecting archaic admixture

My primary research focus is the development and application of computational approaches for population genetic inference to uncover how evolutionary forces—such as genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow—shape genetic diversity, with broad implications for adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and understanding evolutionary history. I am also dedicated to integrating diverse computational approaches into cohesive pipelines, enabling efficient analysis of large-scale genomic datasets while improving reproducibility and accelerating discoveries in evolutionary biology.
