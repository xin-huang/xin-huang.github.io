Hello, I am a student has been working on many problems:

- Detecting natural selection
- Estimating selective pressures
- Quantifying time-varying selective pressures
- Inferring the distribution of fitness effects
- Detecting archaic admixture

Inspired by [the story](https://www.gvm.com.tw/article/14177) of Prof. Wen-Hsiung Li, who was encouraged by Dr. Masatoshi Nei, one of [the founding editors](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/pages/Editorial_Board) of *Molecular Biology and Evolution*, to apply mathematics to genetics—a time when those who understood mathematics in genetics were few and far between—I boldly chose the less-traveled path. Currently, I am interested in applying machine learning, particularly deep learning, to population genetics—an approach still dismissed by some as a **minority perspective** in this field, even though population genetics is not fundamentally different from other disciplines, and machine learning has already achieved undeniable success in fields like computer vision and natural language processing.
