Hello, I am a student has been working on many problems:

- Detecting natural selection
- Estimating selective pressures
- Quantifying time-varying selective pressures
- Inferring the distribution of fitness effects
- Detecting archaic admixture

Inspired by [the story](https://www.gvm.com.tw/article/14177) of Prof. Wen-Hisung Li, who was encouraged by Dr. Masatoshi Nei, one of [the founding editors](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/pages/Editorial_Board) of *Molecular Biology and Evolution*, to apply mathematics to genetics, I boldly chose the less-traveled path. Currently, I am interested in applying machine learning, particularly deep learning, to population genetics, an approach still regarded by some as a **minority** view in the field.
