# Development Guideline

To maintain code quality, ensure consistency, and enable smooth collaboration across the team, it is essential to follow a standardized development workflow. This document outlines best practices for contributing to the project. By adhering to these guidelines, we can reduce bugs, improve readability, and speed up reviews and integration.

---

## 1. Branch Management

- All development code must be submitted to the `dev` branch.
- Do **not** push code directly to the `main` branch.
- All new features, bug fixes, and experiments should be done in the `dev` branch or a feature branch based on `dev`.
- Rather than creating duplicate code via copy-paste, modify the existing code directly in the `dev` branch. Do not worry about breaking things. Git will track all changes, and GitHub provides an easy-to-read visual comparison for reviewing edits.

---

## 2. Code Style and Documentation

- **Write modular, reusable functions** instead of duplicating code through copy-paste.
- Use **NumPy-style docstrings** for all functions and modules.
- Use **Python type hints** to improve clarity and robustness.
- Format your code using [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to enforce consistency.
- Run [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) to check for style issues and potential bugs.

---

## 3. Testing

- Each module in the source code should have a corresponding test file placed in the `tests/` directory.
- Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) to implement and run unit tests.
- Tests should cover core logic and include edge cases.
- Make sure your code **passes all tests** before pushing to GitHub.

---

## 4. Commit Best Practices

- Update your code regularly in small, manageable chunks.
- Avoid large, monolithic commits because they are harder to review and debug.
- (Optional) Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style for consistency.

---

## 5. Pull Requests

- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** when contributing to the `main` branch.
- A reviewer will be notified, review your code, and provide feedback.
- Revise your code based on the feedback before merging into `main`.

---

## 6. Collaboration Tips

- Regularly pull the latest changes from the `dev` branch to avoid conflicts.
- Communicate before making major changes to ensure team alignment.
- Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions or reach out by opening an issue on GitHub.
