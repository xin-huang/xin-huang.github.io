I aim to uncover how evolutionary forces\u2014mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection\u2014shape genetic diversity across species, with broad implications for understanding gene adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and evolutionary history. In addition, I am committed to integrating heterogeneous computational approaches into cohesive, reproducible pipelines, enabling efficient analysis of large-scale genomic datasets. Ultimately, my research seeks to bridge algorithmic innovation and biological discovery, advancing both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of evolutionary genomics.</p>"},{"location":"development/","title":"Development Guideline","text":"<p>To maintain code quality, ensure consistency, and enable smooth collaboration across the team, it is essential to follow a standardized development workflow.
