Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton, who were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for their foundational work on artificial neural networks, further affirms how once-dismissed ideas can revolutionize entire fields. This serves as a reminder that even minority perspectives, when pursued with persistence and rigor, can ultimately transform the landscape of science.</p>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Selected Publications","text":"<p>*</p> <p>Corresponding author</p> \u2022 Hackl J, Huang X<p>*</p>. 2025.
